- add proper module descriptors to all Maven modules
- maybe do something about the awkward putting of LocalAPIClient and RemoteAPIClient into
  different packages just so the Java module system does not complain about a "split package"
- double check enforcerrule/pom.xml and see whether the dependency on the plexus-container-default thingy
  that breaks the build is really needed for stuff to work
- add unit test to make sure what happens if the latest version is blacklisted
  -> server would need to know about the client's blacklist to decide whether to fetch release dates of other versions as well...
  -> would need to know how to compare version numbers so we only have to scrape release dates for versions that are AFTER the current version used by the client 
- make file storage more robust and double-check why after a fresh install, artifact data is only written to disk once the JVM receives a SIGINT
- Upgrade to non-vulnerable dependency versions before release
