  1.) extend the on-disk data format to store a "release date not determined for version number because it is not the most-recent one"
  2.) only fetch release dates of the latest snapshots/releases on the initial fetch
  3.) Do a (slow) synchronous lookup on-demand only when the client currently requesting information has blacklisted the most recent snapshot/release version.

- Upgrade to non-vulnerable dependency versions before release
